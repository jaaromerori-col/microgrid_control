Microgrid simulation comparison.

The files in this folder are intended to compare the behavior of the control system for the microgrid under random conditions.

1. Add all files to the MATLAB path.
2. Open the .m file
3. Configure the number of simulations (Start with 1 to check how much time it takes)
4. Run the code

Two graphs are generated: The first one with the results of the cost function for each simulation and control strategy. The second graph is a box plot of the cost function.
