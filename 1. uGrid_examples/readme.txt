Simple Microgrid simulation.

In those Simulink files, you will find simulation models of a microgrid.
Four control strategies are used: 
- PID 
- Variable PID with KNN gain selector.
- Variable PID with interpolation of gains.
- Variable PID with ANN gain selector.

The conditions of the simulation can be changed: Set-point current, Load resistance, and incoming irradiance. The simulation files contain notes to clarify how to test under other conditions.
