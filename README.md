Microgrid control

Here you will find simulations used for the paper: "Design of variable PI controllers for a DC MIMO Microgrid using Machine Learning"
A microgrid with a solar array and batteries was simulated in MATLAB. An intelligent PID was designed for a variable. Three gain selectors were tested. KNN, an interpolation function, and an ANN. The last one showed the best behavior.
Simulations are organized in three folders:
1. uGrid_examples: Simple simulations to run in Simulink and understand the model.
2. uGrid_configured_by_code: Run the Simulink files from an .m file. This is useful to change conditions in the microgrid from code.
3. uGrid_comparison: Code to compare the three control strategies and analyze results.

Additional instructions can be found in each folder.
