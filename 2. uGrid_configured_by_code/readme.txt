Microgrid simulation changed by code.

This folder contains .m and .slx files that work together.

1. Add all files to the Matlab path.
2. There is a .m and .slx file for each control strategy. Open the .m file you want to work with. Configure the vectors Ir_V, I_pv_sp_V and RL_var_vec to change the parameters in the simulation.
3. Run the .m code

You will see the response of the microgrid under the configured conditions. The .m file was designed to manage the simulink simulation from the code.
